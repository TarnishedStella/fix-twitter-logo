# Fix Twitter Logo
This userscript replaces the new, terribly designed twitter logo with the much better bird logo. 

## How to use

Chrome users: Install [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).\
Firefox users: Install [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).

1. Open [the userscript](https://github.com/TarnishedStella/fix-twitter-logo-userscript/raw/main/fix-twitter-logo.user.js) in a new tab.
1. Click **Install** (or **Update**).
1. Visit [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) and you're done!

## Future Development
Id like to convert this userscript to a real chromium extension and publish it into the chrome web store at some point so its easier to use and download. Ive never actually published there before but I imagine that whole process will take some time before its actually available.

I also attempted to replace the loading icon but the replacement wasn't fast enough for my liking so I opted to leave that portion out until I can figure out a way to make it more seamless.
